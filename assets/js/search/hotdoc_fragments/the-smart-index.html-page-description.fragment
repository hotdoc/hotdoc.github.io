On top of that users can override extension\ndecision about what symbols should be added to what page and in what\norder, the combination of those two possibilities is what we call\nsmart indexing.\nSmart indexing is made by a specific extension, for example if you are\ndocumenting a C library you should use the --c-smart-index option so\nthat the C extension takes control and build the index for its section.\nBasically, during smart indexing of C code, the extension will build one\noutput page per header ('.h') file.\nAs previously explained, the user can override default behaviour, and\nthis is done through a .markdown page that has the same name as the\nsource file. For example, in the case of documenting a C library\nwhere you have the following header file example-header.h:\nThe C extension should document second_function first but we can\noverride the behaviour adding a file called example-header.h.markdown\nspecifying the symbols to be documented in the wanted order as follow:\n"});
