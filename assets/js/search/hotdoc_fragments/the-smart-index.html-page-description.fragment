On top of that users can override extension decision about what symbols should be added to what page and in what order the combination of those two possibilities is what we call smart indexing. \nSmart indexing is made by a specific extension for example if you are documenting a C library you should use the c smart index option so that the C extension takes control and build the index for its section. Basically during smart indexing of C code the extension will build one output page per header h file. \nAs previously explained the user can override default behaviour and this is done through a markdown page that has the same name as the source file. For example in the case of documenting a C library where you have the following header file example header.h \nThe C extension should document second_function first but we can override the behaviour adding a file called example header.h.markdown specifying the symbols to be documented in the wanted order as follow \n"});
