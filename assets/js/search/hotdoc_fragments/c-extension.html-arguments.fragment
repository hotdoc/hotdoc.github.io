If not specified, an empty page will be\ngenerated.\n--c-sources, c_sources: List of sources to parse, can contain patterns which\nwill be passed through glob\n--c-source-filters, c_source_filters: List of sources to exclude, can contain\npatterns which will be passed through glob. This is useful when passing patterns\nto c_sources\n--c-source-roots, c_source_roots: List of root directories paths should be\nmade relative to.
