Along with\nits final output, it produces a database of symbols and a dependency\ngraph, which can be reused at the next run.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc_server\">hotdoc_server</a> uses\nhotdoc to provide (for now basic) wiki-like functionalities: users\ncan edit and preview the documentation, and the server patches the sources it was\nextracted from.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"running.html#disabling-incremental-build\">disabling incremental build</a> if you do not wish / need to use this feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"simple-yet-powerful-syntax\">Simple yet powerful syntax</h2>\n<p>Hotdoc follows the <a href=\"http://commonmark.org/\">CommonMark</a> specification\nand uses <a href=\"https://github.com/jgm/cmark\">cmark</a> to parse and render\nstandalone documentation pages.</p>\n<p>This format was chosen because it is very simple to edit, yet allows\na great amount of control over the resulting layout, and the main\ndesign requirement behind the choice of the format was to lower as\nmuch as possible the barrier to contribute to documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"themeability\">Themeability</h2>\n<p>The hotdoc html formatter supports theming. Its base output has\nno stylesheets or scripts applied to it whatsoever, this is handled by themes,\nwhich can additionally override the base templates. By default, hotdoc will use\na theme based on bootstrap and isotope, see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc_bootstrap_theme\">https://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc_bootstrap_theme</a>\nfor its sources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api\">API</h2>\n<p>Hotdoc 1.0 will expose a (reasonably) stable API, its intended users being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extension writers, which will find the task of documenting a new language\nmuch easier than writing a tool from scratch.</li>\n<li>Application writers, which will be able to use it for all sorts of\ndocumentation-related tasks, ranging from retrieving the raw docstring\nfor a given symbol, to showing a live preview during editing of any\ndocumentation snippet.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"examples.html#hotdocs-own-bootstrapped-documentation\">the bootstraped documentation</a> to get a first taste of the API.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
