Along with\nits final output, it produces a database of symbols and a dependency\ngraph, which can be reused at the next run.\nSee disabling incremental build\nif you do not wish / need to use this feature.\nHotdoc follows the CommonMark specification\nand uses cmark to parse and render\nstandalone documentation pages.\nThis format was chosen because it is very simple to edit, yet allows\na great amount of control over the resulting layout, and the main\ndesign requirement behind the choice of the format was to lower as\nmuch as possible the barrier to contribute to documentation.\nSee Extensions to the CommonMark syntax for more information.\nThe hotdoc html formatter supports theming. Its base output has\nno stylesheets or scripts applied to it whatsoever, this is handled by themes,\nwhich can additionally override the base templates. By default, hotdoc will use\na theme based on bootstrap and isotope, see\nhttps://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc_bootstrap_theme\nfor its sources.\nHotdoc 1.0 will expose a (reasonably) stable API, its intended users being:\n\nExtension writers, which will find the task of documenting a new language\nmuch easier than writing a tool from scratch.\nApplication writers, which will be able to use it for all sorts of\ndocumentation-related tasks, ranging from retrieving the raw docstring\nfor a given symbol, to showing a live preview during editing of any\ndocumentation snippet.\n\n"});
