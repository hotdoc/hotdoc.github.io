See The smart index for more information. \nc include directories c_include_directories List of include directories equivalent to clang s I \npkg config packages pkg_config_packages List of packages the library depends upon \nextra c flags extra_c_flags Extra flags to use when compiling eg D U \nc index c_index Optional path to a markdown file that will be parsed and used as the index for the extension in the sitemap. If not specified an empty page will be generated. \nc sources c_sources List of sources to parse can contain patterns which will be passed through glob \nc source filters c_source_filters List of sources to exclude can contain patterns which will be passed through glob. This is useful when passing patterns to c_sources \nc source roots c_source_roots List of root directories paths should be made relative to. This is useful when generated sources are documented to avoid ending up with an unnecessarily deep sitemap. \n"});
