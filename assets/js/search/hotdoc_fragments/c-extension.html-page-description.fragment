fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"c-extension.html#page-description","fragment":"The C extension can be used to parse C source files to extract comments and\nsymbols.\nThe extension uses Clang to build and walk an AST from the source code, as\nsuch it is necessary for the build environment to allow its compilation, and\narguments are exposed to allow specifying the C flags and / or the names of the\ndependencies that C flags should be obtained from using pkg-config.\nOn a Debian-based OS you will need to install llvm and libclang-dev packages.\nCurrently, comments are expected to be formatted according to the gtk-doc syntax.\nThis extension exposes the following arguments / configuration options:\n--c-index, c_index: Name of the root markdown file, which can be None. See\nThe smart index for more information.\n--c-include-directories, c_include_directories: List of include directories, equivalent\nto clang's -I\n--pkg-config-packages, pkg_config_packages: List of packages the library depends upon\n--extra-c-flags, extra_c_flags: Extra flags to use when compiling, eg -D, -U\n--c-index, c_index: Optional path to a markdown file that will be parsed and used\nas the index for the extension in the sitemap. If not specified, an empty page will be\ngenerated.\n--c-sources, c_sources: List of sources to parse, can contain patterns which\nwill be passed through glob\n--c-source-filters, c_source_filters: List of sources to exclude, can contain\npatterns which will be passed through glob. This is useful when passing patterns\nto c_sources\n--c-source-roots, c_source_roots: List of root directories paths should be\nmade relative to. This is useful when generated sources are documented, to avoid\nending up with an unnecessarily deep sitemap.\n\n\n--c-index, c_index: Name of the root markdown file, which can be None.
