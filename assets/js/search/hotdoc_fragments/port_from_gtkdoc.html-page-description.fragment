We will start with the gdk library as a first step always start by the lowest library in the dependency tree of the project \nLet s generate the documenation for Gdk with meson. In that example we will add the meson snipnet in docs reference gdk meson.build. \nTo simplify the transcription of that documentation to other projects we will export the HOTDOC_DOCUMENTATION_ROOT variable like that \nThe following files will be required first \n"});
