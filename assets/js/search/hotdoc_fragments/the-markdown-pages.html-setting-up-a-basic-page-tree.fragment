In our case,\nwe did not provide any title metadata, so the title picked for\nour subpage is the first heading found in the page. Try defining\nthe title metadata in the yaml header if that's your thing :)\nIf all you want hotdoc to do is help you in generating a multi-page website\nfrom a set of markdown files, then you can stop reading this page, throw an\neye at this page and\nthis one too though, can't hurt.\nIf however you also want to use one or more hotdoc extensions to parse source\ncode files and document the symbols that they contain, then keep on reading.\n\n\nHotdoc will by default look for subpages in the folder where the provided\nindex is located, so only the basenames need to be input in the sitemap.\nAdditional folders in which to look for documentation pages (but also code\nsamples) can be provided to hotdoc via the include-paths\nconfiguration option.\n\n\nLinks to pages in the doc tree are updated at format-time, in our example\nindex.markdown will be updated to index.html when outputting html.\n\n\nThe metadata in the yaml headers is not directly visible in the pages\nthey document, but it is used when presenting subpages.
