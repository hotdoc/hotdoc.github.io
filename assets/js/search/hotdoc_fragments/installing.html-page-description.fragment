See Build options for more info.\nClang and llvm-config are runtime dependencies for the C extension.\nThe search extension is implemented in C, and index creation depends on glib and json-glib.\nOn Fedora you can install all these dependencies with:\nAnd on ubuntu / debian:\nWe'll be happy to merge updates to this list if you have successfully built hotdoc on another platform.\nIt is highly recommended to use a virtual env to try out any new python project, and hotdoc is no exception. You can however skip this step if you really do not\nmind installing hotdoc system-wide.\nAssuming pip is installed\nYou are now in a virtual environment, to exit it you may call deactivate, to enter it again simply call . hotdoc_env/bin/activate from the directory in which the environment was created.\nTo ensure that extensions with optional dependencies are enabled when installing hotdoc, the setup script will look at the following environment variables:\nThis awkward way of passing options is due to setuptools' limitations.\nThree main alternatives are available:\nUsing pip to get the last released version of hotdoc:\nInstalling a \"read-only\" version from a github clone:\nInstalling an editable version from a github clone:\n\n\nHOTDOC_BUILD_C_EXTENSION: one of enabled, disabled or auto.
